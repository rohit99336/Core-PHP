    <p>Also, if two operators of the same precedence (priority) are present, associativity determines the direction in
        which they execute.</p>

    <p>Let us consider an example:</p>

    <pre>
1 == 2 != 3</pre>

    <p>Here, operators <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> have the same precedence. And, their associativity is from
        left to right. Hence, <code>1 == 2</code> is executed first.</p>

    <p>The expression above is equivalent to:</p>

    <pre>
(1 == 2) != 3</pre>

    <p class="note-tip"><strong>Note:</strong> If a statement has multiple operators, you can use parentheses
        <code>()</code> to make the code more readable.</p>
